# Reverse Engineering & Decryption Services

This project showcases my work in software analysis, decryption, and reverse engineering.  
The included webpage is a clean and minimal portfolio highlighting the services I provide and the tools I use.

## Overview

I work with encrypted files, protected executables, obfuscated scripts, and low-level program behavior.  
My focus is on helping users understand or regain access to software they legally own.

This project includes:

- A responsive portfolio website  
- Service descriptions for analysis, debugging, and decryption  
- Clean and minimal interface
